Project to display, as well as calculate unions and intersections of various interval sets. Project had to operate 1 million operations
in under 30 seconds with no errors, given inputs from a tester program, found here http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/java305/IntervalUnionTest.java
from a secret rng seed to be released after the project was due. My program was able to compute 1 million operations in under 2 seconds, with correct outputs, 
recieving a mark of 80% (determined by its operation in comparison to the rest of the class)
